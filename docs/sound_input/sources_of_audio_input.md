Phonemics 2.0 - Sources of audio input
======================================


20.07.2022

## Where does the sound come from

The only audio input for our project are koran readings (recordings), which we download from the internet. The clearest recordings available on Youtube come from *Sheikh Mahmoud Khalil Al Hosari* (now abbreviated as "hus").

There are many other reciters of the koran which can be found on Youtube.
Virtually all of them have come with bad audio quality:
* Lots of echoes
* muffled sound (bad recording)
* background noise
* without clear pronounciation (bad reading)

As for now (July 2022) we have identified three recordings, which we may take as sound input sources.

### Good 
This is the recording of Al Hosari, which we used for the first version. It rendered 8.3 GB of .wav audio files. The style of this reading is **Tartiil**

The data files are stored under **hus0h**

### Better
This is another recording of Al Hosari, which seems to have a slightly better audio quality. It will be the source for version 2.0. The style of this reading is **Tartiil**

The data files are stored under **hus1h**

### Extremely slow
Another recording of Al Hosari, which is slow. It comes with long pauses between the phrases. What makes it interesting, is the more melodic style of reading. The style of this reading is **Tajweed**

The data files are stored under **hus9h**

### Combinations
Its not yet decided, if the audio base could be combined of two or more recordings. It would help to get a more complete sound base, but we must make sure, that the sound is very similar.

The workload (storage, processing time) for a single recoding is already very high. Combining more than one recording will increase the pain.
